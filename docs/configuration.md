# Configuration

LoreMaster is configured in your editor's settings, under `loreMaster.*`. Open them from
**Settings**, filtered with `@ext:LoreMaster.loremaster`, or from the command
**LoreMaster: Open settings**. Every option has a description, its allowed values and a
default.

Secrets are never settings. The Confluence token is asked for once and kept in the editor's
secret store, keyed by the Confluence address, so it serves every workspace.

## Where a value can live

Settings layer the way VS Code's always do, the most specific winning:

**folder > workspace > user > default**

Set what is yours once, in **User** settings, and let a workspace override it only where it
differs:

```jsonc
// User settings.json: applies to every workspace
{
  "loreMaster.confluence.baseUrl": "https://acme.atlassian.net/wiki",
  "loreMaster.defaults.mermaidMode": "image"
}
```

```jsonc
// .vscode/settings.json of one repository
{
  "loreMaster.outputs": [
    { "platform": "confluence", "space": "ENG", "parentPageId": "98306", "titlePrefix": "ENG" }
  ],
  "loreMaster.ignore": ["internal/"]
}
```

A list (`outputs`, `ignore`, `generators`) set at a more specific level **replaces** the
less specific one; it is not appended to it.

## The settings

| Setting | What it is |
|---|---|
| `loreMaster.outputs` | The places the lore goes: platform, space, parent page, title prefix, direction, content, Mermaid mode, links, repository and branch, `include` and `exclude` lists. |
| `loreMaster.confluence.baseUrl` | The Confluence address an output uses unless it sets its own `baseUrl`. |
| `loreMaster.defaults.*` | The `direction`, `mermaidMode`, `linkMode` and `titleCollision` of an output that does not set them. |
| `loreMaster.ignore` | Gitignore-style patterns every output leaves out. |
| `loreMaster.skipGitignored` | Leave out Markdown that `.gitignore` ignores. Default on. |
| `loreMaster.generators` | Generators that write Markdown from test reports and source documentation. |

The editor's own preferences (`loreMaster.pages.*`, `loreMaster.generateBeforeSync`,
`loreMaster.watchDebounceSeconds`, `loreMaster.engine.path`) are separate and are not part of
the configuration.

A misspelt key or field is reported with the file and the key, and a key that looks like a
secret (`token`, `password`, ...) is refused.

## Who reads it

| | Reads |
|---|---|
| The VS Code extension, the engine, the MCP server | The settings above: the user's `settings.json`, then the folder's `.vscode/settings.json`, the folder winning. |
| The command line (`lore-master sync`, `pages`, `generate`) | The same. Commit `.vscode/settings.json` for CI to find it. |
| The GitHub Action | Its inputs (planned: #308). Until then it reads the folder's settings like the command line. |

## From `.lore-master.yaml`

The first time the extension activates in a workspace that has a `.lore-master.yaml` and no
`loreMaster.outputs` setting, it imports the file into `.vscode/settings.json` and tells you
once. The YAML is left where it is and is no longer read once the settings exist; delete it
when you like. A workspace with neither is configured in settings from the start.

The decision and its trade-offs are in
[architecture/configuration-in-editor-settings.md](architecture/configuration-in-editor-settings.md).
