# LoreMaster — Claude Code Project Guide

## What this is

**LoreMaster** is a family of editor plugins that gathers a project's lore. The first
feature syncs every Markdown file in an open workspace into a documentation platform,
Confluence first (Cloud, Data Center, and the end-of-life Server). More platforms and
more kinds of lore come later, which is why nothing here is named after Confluence or
Markdown.

## Two rules that govern all work here

1. **Every step is a GitHub issue before it is built.** The issues are the durable
   record; this file and `ROADMAP.md` only index them. A change without an issue is a
   change nobody can retrace.
2. **Every gap found in `@mnci/cli` is fixed in `russoedu/MoNecromanCi` and filed as an
   issue there** (label `found-by:lore-master`). This repo never works around mnci by
   hand without an issue saying so.

## Decisions already made (do not re-litigate)

| Decision | Choice | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Name | LoreMaster; extension id `<publisher>.lore-master` | #43, #44 |
| Engine language | **Go**, one sidecar binary spoken to over JSON-RPC on stdio by every editor shell | `docs/architecture/engine-and-shells.md` |
| Distribution | No npm packages. The engine binary doubles as a small CLI (`generate`, `sync`, `tree`; `docs/cli.md`, #273) for CI and hooks, distributed by #201. The extension goes to the VS Code Marketplace (later the Visual Studio Marketplace). The binary ships inside each extension | E5 #6, #65 |
| Layout | Vertical feature slices in Go **and** TypeScript, even where no lint enforces it | `docs/architecture/vertical-feature-slices.md`, #47 |
| Page titles | `<titlePrefix>: <H1>`; prefix asked once at first sync, default = selected parent page's title | E3 #4 |
| Config file | The editor's settings, `loreMaster.*` (`outputs[]`, `ignore`, `generators`, `confluence.baseUrl`, `defaults.*`), layered folder > workspace > user (#308, `docs/configuration.md`). Tokens stay in the secret store, never in settings. `.lore-master.yaml` is a deprecated fallback, imported into `.vscode/settings.json` on first activation. `direction: two-way` is accepted (#163); still-reserved values (other content types, templates) are in the schema but refused until built | #308, #92, #32; #95 #96 #97 |
| Mermaid | Default `image`: code macro + SVG attachment rendered by the editor's webview; `code`, `html-macro`, `marketplace-macro` selectable | E6 #7 |
| Test runner (TS shell) | Jest | #45 |
| Auth | Cloud: email + API token; DC: PAT; Server: PAT ≥ 7.9 else basic. **No OAuth** — removed in #208 (was E7 #8); reconsider only post-preview | `docs/architecture/confluence-editions.md` |
| Monorepo tooling | `@mnci/cli` (Nx), GitHub Actions CI, merge commits only | #45, #50 |

```

Dependency direction, one way, enforced by the Go compiler:
`lore-master-engine` → `documentation-sync` → {`markdown-workspace`, `confluence-client`}.
`confluence-client` knows nothing about the engine; `documentation-sync` owns the
`DocumentationPlatform` and `DiagramRenderer` interfaces and a `confluenceplatform`
adapter package. A second platform is another adapter package.

## Slice rules in one screen

Capability → flat slice → role-suffixed files. Full ADR: `docs/architecture/vertical-feature-slices.md`.

- **Go**: a slice is one package directory directly under the project root. Exported
  identifiers are the barrel. A lib root holds only `doc.go`; an app root only `main.go`
  (+ `main_test.go`). Files are `<snake>_<role>.go`, tests `<snake>_<role>_test.go`, test
  data in `testdata/`. Package name = directory name, lowercase, no separators
  (`documenttree`). No sub-packages inside a slice. No `util`, `helpers`, `common`,
  `shared`, `internal`, `lib` packages.
- **TypeScript** (`apps/lore-master-vscode/src`): `<kebab>.<role>.ts`, one `index.ts` per
  slice, only `main.ts` at the root (`extension.ts` is rejected by the lint), tests
  `<name>.spec.ts`. Enforced by `@mnci/eslint-config`'s `verticalSlices` rules.
- Roles, both languages: `handler use-case algorithm policy model contract mapper
  validator repository client store error config enum`.
- Place a file in the slice whose outcome breaks if the file is deleted.

## How the sync works (the short version)

1. Discover `.md` files (roots/excludes from `.lore-master.yaml`), parse with goldmark,
   title = first H1, build the tree: explicit `parent:` → dotted filename
   (`readme.architecture.md` under `readme.md`) → directory index (`README.md`) → the
   selected Confluence parent.
2. Plan: per file compare the `<!-- lore-master … -->` annotation (page id, version,
   content hash, attachment hashes) with the file and the remote page →
   `create | update | move | rename_title | adopt | unchanged | conflict | orphan`.
3. Execute parents-first: render Mermaid through the editor, upload changed attachments,
   create/update/move the page in storage format; links are `ri:page` by the target's
   prefixed title, known locally, so cycles resolve on the first pass.
4. Write annotations back only to files whose page changed. Report.

## Working in this repo

```bash
npm run lint      # ESLint (TS shell) + golangci-lint (Go) + tools/slicecheck
npm run test      # jest + go test ./...
npm run build     # engine binaries + extension bundle
npm run format    # eslint --fix (there is no Prettier)
npx nx run lore-master-vscode:test-integration   # the extension in a real VS Code host (not in CI); run it after changing package.json contributions
VERSION=1.2.3 npx nx run lore-master-engine:build-all   # six static engine binaries, stamped
npx nx run lore-master-vscode:package   # 8 .vsix in dist/drop, engine in bin/, stamped with the extension version
```

The extension is `apps/lore-master-vscode` (Nx project `lore-master-vscode`, pinned by
`nx.name`) but ships as `LoreMaster.loremaster`: the manifest `name` is free to differ.
Debug it with the `lore-master-vscode: debug` launch entry (Extension Development Host).

- Go import paths are `lore-master/libs/<lib>/<slice>`. The module name comes
  from the npm scope (MoNecromanCi#236); fine for an app nobody `go get`s.
- Until MoNecromanCi#228 (`--registry none`) ships, one known red is expected:
  `mnci doctor` flags the unused `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` line in `.npmrc`.
- Every merge to `main` releases the extension: `nx release` versions
  `lore-master-vscode` from conventional commits (it is in scope through its
  `type:vscode-extension` tag), tags it and creates a GitHub Release. It then
  publishes to the Marketplace through **Microsoft Entra ID** (no stored secret):
  the release job signs in with `azure/login` (OIDC, `id-token: write`) as the
  `lore-master-marketplace` app registration and the script runs
  `vsce publish --azure-credential` (`VSCE_AUTH=entra`, gated on the
  `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`/`AZURE_TENANT_ID` repo variables, both set). No `VSCE_PAT`.
  The identity setup is #44; MoNecromanCi#253 shipped the mnci support in 4.13.0.
  The extension ships as a **preview** (`"preview": true`) until the sync is real.
- mnci is the published CLI: `npx @mnci/cli@latest upgrade` (≥ 4.13.0, which carries
  the fixes this workspace was bootstrapped with, MoNecromanCi#227 Go half, #233, #234,
  #235, #237, the engine's six-platform `build-all`/`package-all`, #226, the
  `vscode-extension` kind, #225 #229 #243 #247 #249, Entra ID publishing #253, and the
  audit-gate fix #255).
  `mnci upgrade` on a clean checkout must leave `git status` empty.
- Before committing: `npm run format`, then `git diff` (mnci-owned files change on
  `mnci upgrade`; review them).
- Conventional commits are enforced by commitlint; `nx release` versions the extension
  from them. Merge PRs with a **merge commit**, never squash or rebase (#50).
- Secrets never touch this repo or `.lore-master.yaml`; they live in the editor's secret
  store and travel to the engine per session over stdio.

## Where to look

- `ROADMAP.md` — every epic, decision and mnci dependency with links and status.
- `docs/architecture/engine-and-shells.md` — why one Go sidecar, the RPC surface,
  rejected alternatives.
- `docs/architecture/confluence-editions.md` — the verified API facts per edition.
- `russoedu/MoNecromanCi` issues labelled `found-by:lore-master` — the mnci work this project found or waits on.
